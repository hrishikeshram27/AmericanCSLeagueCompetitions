# AmericanCSLeagueCompetitions

This contains my code from the ACSL competitions of the 2017-2018, 2018-2019, and 2019-2020 seasons, in which I received numerous perfect scores in both timed, theoretical written tests on various CS topics such as boolean algebra and assembly language, as well as various timed programming tasks.
